## Project Description/Outline:
Utilize two or more datasets to complete ETL and provide an outline of the following:
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

## Datasets:
Use the following datasets related to Gas prices, unemployment rate and homicide reports.
* https://www.kaggle.com/mruanova/us-gasoline-and-diesel-retail-prices-19952021
* https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-monthly-unemployment-rate-1948-present

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
* Finalize datasets to utilize
* Extract into DataFrames
* Clean and join the data and determine data points to use
* Create Database Connection
* Load Into Database
